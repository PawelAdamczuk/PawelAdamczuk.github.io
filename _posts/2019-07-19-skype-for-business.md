title: 'Skype for Business'

The Android version of Skype for Business won't log me in unless:

- I give it access to my smartphone's camera
- I give it access to my smartphone's microphone
- I give it access to my smartphone's storage
- I give it access to my contacts
- I give it access to manage phone calls on my smartphone
- I provide my phone number

If I provide a fake phone number and try to revoke all the permissions after logging in, it automatically logs me out.

**Where did we go wrong?**
