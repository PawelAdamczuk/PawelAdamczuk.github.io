title: 'HPSTR: Grav theme customization'
---

I wanted to customize the theme my old website was using. I needed to have my own fork and I didn't want to modify the compiled SASS styles directly. In the original repo, though, there were no instructions on how the styles have been compiled in the first place. I shouldn't have had to spend four hours reverse-engineering how that was done, but I did, and the results are in my fork. A pull request is on its way as well. Take a look at the kind of stuff I had to do to recreate the compiled .css file in full.

I know, there probably is a better way. I hope I never have to do this kind of thing again.

**That being said, a huge shoutout to guys who created [Grav](https://getgrav.org/about). Awesome FOSS work!**
