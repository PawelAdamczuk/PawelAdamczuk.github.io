suffer prisms of our chemistry  
where once were two now there's the wicked three  
you lay awake, then lie in dreams of me  
the only place where we can both be free  
  
caress the glass, it's all you get tonight  
nothing will change, though I still thought I might  
flatten the wrinkles on your white night satin shirt  
instead I tear my heart apart and spill the dirt  
  
labyrinthine corridors spell lonely nights  
I still remember you, there's more in me to die  
I rake my brain, the cruel janitor of thoughts  
it isn't real, and never was, that's all she wrote  
  
corral your eerie thoughs and pile them up  
gather your every doubt, it's time to stop  
now light the pyre, dance through the flames and feel it burn  
the bright catastrophe, two hearts that took wrong turns  
  
put the ashes in a jar on the top shelf  
and every now and then when you're all by yourself  
remember all the pasts that you could have received  
don't put them on a scale, please just forget and live
