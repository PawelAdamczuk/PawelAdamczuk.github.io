Calves gift-wrapped in tasteful nylon  
Shoulders clad in flowing black  
Wickedly, dreams of you pile-on,  
Lonely days of want still stack  
  
Handsome devil deals  
aces in your dreams  
run, you cannot hide  
all your faith has died  
  
Lie, proclaiming wishful love  
Seek the life you still dream of  
Till death finally does you part  
suffocate your lonely heart  
  
Pray to gods blind to your grace  
Hope a miracle one day  
Sweeps away your self-made sorrows  
Brings a brand-new, bright tomorrow  
  
Spreadsheet princess, you can't count  
What you've lost and live without  
Had your chance to take the leap  
golden chains put you to sleep
