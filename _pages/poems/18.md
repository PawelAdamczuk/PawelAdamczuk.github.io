I was up there. Where the free rejoice. Where there is no time. Feelings free-floating through space. A cosmic collective of souls that lost the shell of the ego. I could hear the heavenly music, bassy and foggy, reaching me gently, caressing me. The lights and colors blinking steadily like some kind of cosmic disco. And I knew at that moment that this is where I will go once I die. Far up there, higher than clouds, higher than the sun, where nothing reaches but pure energy, I will join the pool of light... and I will finally feel whole.
