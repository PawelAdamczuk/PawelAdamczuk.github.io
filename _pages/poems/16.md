Mermaid graceful, laugh at will,  
resurrect me, make all still.  
Eyes spark deep in brightest black,  
I get lost till stone heart cracks.  
  
Didn't think yet next disaster  
my damned fate could ever muster.  
Dream deep blue, fall soft and fast,  
stake my poor soul, if I must.  
  
Into lust laced depth I wander,  
never twice I stop and ponder  
how I've walked that path before...  
Nevermind, I must walk more.  
  
Catch the high tide, ride the wave,  
watch me burn and watch me crave,  
never willing, but accomplice.  
This love never shall become bliss.
