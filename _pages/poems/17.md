Brian Eno - Ambient 1: Music for Airports  
  
This is the cooldown music. This is laying on the floor with your arms and legs crossed out. Feel the coldness under your shoulders. The calm, sleepy but attentive contemplation following the mystical insanity of a shamanic experience. After the visit in the land of the Dead, you're back on Earth again. Safe and sound, with so many brand new thoughts consuming your psyche. Just let the gentle piano notes lead the insight into what has been learned, as you safely fall in and out of hypnagogia over and over again. You can rest now.  

The music brings images of an expansive white atrium. An art gallery? A cosmodrome? The waiting room of an afterlife? It is filled with a low murmur of tens of people shuffling around. They go about their business as usual, but they tactfully keep their voices low - they  can feel the solemn air of the place.
