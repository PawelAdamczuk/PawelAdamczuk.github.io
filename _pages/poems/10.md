pretty pretty, brittle glass  
all the skeletons come home  
smeared up make-up, wine in flasks  
thoughts are loud when you're alone  
  
in the dark the pressure's rising fast  
you hear your heartbeat through the noise  
you wonder if it's gonna last  
you pray to hear somebody's voice  
  
turn on the telly, hear the news  
the world's on fire, come what may  
to sleep or cry you cannot choose  
you swear you'll snap one of these days  
  
take your pills, relive the thrills  
of nights without an end in sight  
draw the curtains, write the will  
you weren't born for sweet delight
