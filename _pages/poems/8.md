all the stars have shuffled off  
the spotlight's on, the stage is yours  
ler us see what you're made of  
voice is shaking, age does show  
  
remember the first time you skinned your knee  
the whole world was there in a second to see  
uncles, doctors, band-aids, pills  
for a moment, life was still  
  
you're in caring hands, you cry  
someone's holding your hand tight  
cards with scribbles say "do fine"  
soft blanket, tea, and you're alright  
  
first love, aching on your own  
silent rooms and empty halls  
you reach out, they try to help  
do not cross, personal hell  
  
scream for doctors, try to stop  
blood still gushing out your heart  
walk the ledge, hoping to drop  
everybody's way too far  
  
glide through crimson paragraphs  
sometimes paper's all you got  
scribbles, masochistic paths  
as in poems, in heart rot  
  
slow down, darling, choose to be  
throw that skull into the closet  
try, survive, and you might see  
after years a way to close it  
  
until then walk earth alone  
day-to-day saves brittle minds  
one stone in your heart's small load  
many more in life you'll find
