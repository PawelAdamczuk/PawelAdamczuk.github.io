Not anymore. I came to the office, greeted my co-workers, turned on my laptop. There seemed to be an update, but I'm already used to seeing those at random moments. What I'm not used to seeing, however, is software I have never installed popping up in the foreground.</p>.<figure>.<a rel="lightbox" href="/user/pages/blog/why-microsoft/1.png"><img alt="" src="/user/pages/blog/why-microsoft/1.png"></a>.<figcaption>Sure enough, the e-mail address had been filled in.</figcaption>.</figure>.<p>I didn't install Teams on my laptop. I use it on a daily basis, but I never had a need to install it locally. I've always had a suspicion that the "native" version is just the web app wrapped in Electron, taking up more RAM than the web version (Slack, anyone?). I decided I must have done that by accident or to experiment or something in the past. That timestamp speaks for itself, though.</p>.<figure class="half">.<a rel="lightbox" href="/user/pages/blog/why-microsoft/2.png"><img alt="" src="/user/pages/blog/why-microsoft/2.png"></a>.<a rel="lightbox" href="/user/pages/blog/why-microsoft/3.png"><img alt="" src="/user/pages/blog/why-microsoft/3.png"></a>.<a rel="lightbox" href="/user/pages/blog/why-microsoft/4.png"><img alt="" src="/user/pages/blog/why-microsoft/4.png"></a>.<figcaption>What, no 'Uninstall' button?</figcaption>.</figure>.<p>After getting rid of the Teams app, I got down to catching up with all the e-mails, only to be interrupted again. You'll never guess.</p>.<figure>.<a rel="lightbox" href="/user/pages/blog/why-microsoft/5.png"><img alt="" src="/user/pages/blog/why-microsoft/5.png"></a>.<figcaption>Microsoft working hard to secure my digital future.</figcaption>.</figure>.<p>As I had only 20 minutes to save my work, I cued the restart and went to grab a coffee. Half an hour later, I restarted the machine stuck on the HP boot logo. Yes, it had happened before. After clicking the tray notification about a failed update, I got no useful information that could be passed along to my IT department. The failed update wasn't even on the list. Thanks, Microsoft. Whatever, as long as the rest is working, I can do my job.</p>.<p>Later during the day, I wanted to check my Skype (the regular one). I was greeted with the usual UAC prompt and clicked "No" without much hesitation. Not today. Let's do it some other time.</p>.<figure>.<a rel="lightbox" href="/user/pages/blog/why-microsoft/6.jpg"><img alt="" src="/user/pages/blog/why-microsoft/6.jpg"></a>.<figcaption>Curiously, you cannot screencap UAC prompts.</figcaption>.</figure>.<p>Only after trying to run Skype three times, I noticed that it would not start the app without the update. What utter nonsense. And this isn't even the version of Skype for Windows 10 that cannot be easily turned off. Don't get me started on that. I sighed and let the updater do its thing just to be able to read my co-workers' messages.</p>.<p>Later in the day, I wanted to listen to some music. My headphones failed to connect. The Settings app, trying to be helpful, informed me that I should turn onn Bluetooth. Sadly, the Bluetooth switch was nowhere to be seen. Another tip from Settings also failed - the device was not visible in the Device Manager (thankfully, that hasn't been ported out of the Control Panel yet). I could not even attempt to reinstall the device drivers. I restarted the computer. The headphones reconnected. They now lag even without multi-point Bluetooth enabled. And those are $350 Bose headphones. That's some material for a whole another rant, though.</p>.<p>I know that supporting thousands of different hardware configurations is a spectacular feat. I know that trying to visually update such a huge pile of legacy code is no easy task. I know there are many backwards compatibility issues along the way. What I don't understand is why such a monumental undertaking coincides with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/03/windows-leader-terry-myerson-out-as-microsoft-reorganizes-windows-division/">the relatively recent Microsoft reorganization</a>, one that seemingly lowers Windows's importance in the company's vision of the future.</p>.                              </div><!-- /.entry-content -->.            </article><!-- /.hentry -->.                    <article class="hentry">.              <header>.                <div class="entry-meta">.                  <span class="entry-date date published updated"><time datetime="September 9th at 4:22pm"><a href="/blog/the-akg-512-mkii">September 09, 2019</a></time></span><span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/about" title="About Pawe..

The audio quality was sufficiently good, but my ears aren't picky - to me, much more important pros of those headphones were the weight and breathability. After the AKGs wore off, I got a pair of Sennheiser HD 518s and used it as my main desktop headset for several years. When the ear cushions were no longer in an acceptable state, l looked up a replacement and found that it would cost me around $40. The K512 MKII were around $55 back in the day, and while their sound quality does not rival that of the Sennheiser HD 518, they were much more comfortable. Imagine my surprise when I found out that they were no longer being produced and there was nothing remotely resembling their design in AKG's current lineup. A couple of questions arise.</p>.<ul>.<li>Why would a headphone manufacturer decommission such a good product?</li>.<li>Why do all the current designs in this price range differ significantly from the K512 MKII in all the worst ways?</li>.<li>Why is nobody producing clones of such an exceptional headphone design?</li>.</ul>.<p>Now surely not everyone would call the K512 MKII "exceptional". Not everyone is as bent on comfort as I am. Most people would choose the Sennheiser cans vecause of their superior audio quality, even if they were comfortable only for the first half an hour of wearing (luckily, they're not so bad). To me, it's very important to be able to wear your headphones for three hours and not even remember that you have them on. That being said, I imagine I'm not conpletely alone here.</p>.<p>Let me tackle the most puzzling question first. I really have no idea why I'm not able to find headphones designed similarly to the K512 MKII on, say, Alibaba. I'm guessing that's caused by intellectual property laws - maybe it's patented, maybe some automatic copyright protections apply, I don't know. Maybe everyone is too busy copying Apple to realise that my favourite pair of headphones ever existed.</p>.<p>As to AKG decommissioning the headphones... I think the K512 MKII might have become a victim of their own success. AKG realised that if they kept making entry level models that (for an average Joe like me) would rival the top of their line, their RnD investment would not pay off. Kind of like Samsung deciding to not include waterproofing in their mid-range smartphone line. The 2017 A5 was an exceptional smartphone that ticked off all the boxes on my personal flagship checklist back in the day while boasting a price tag of around a half of the flagship range. In 2019, I was left with the flagship choices just because Samsung took off a couple of rubber seals from their mid range models. In a similar vein, I now stopped using AKG products altogether just because they decided to make their entry models uncomfortable. It might be an overall headphone design snafu - I didn't try on any of the &gt;$200 headphones from AKG - but I'm fairly certain the materials on the more expensive models are of much higher quality while staying similar in manufacturing costs.</p>.<p>There is a broader underlying theme that I'm seeing in the headphone market. I think there used to be more headphone models from manufacturers like AKG or Bose, and now most companies decided to streamline their product lines. It's common these days to have one flagship headphones model dedicated to the general market (as opposed to the audiophile community) and, thanks to Apple, we can be sure this model will be wireless. I'm going to keep whining about this fact until Bluetooth becomes usable. I'm going to keep whining about this fact until companies producing headphones start treating wireless connectivity seriously.</p>.<p>I don't know and I'll probably never know: was K512 MKII's demise a conscious effort or plain old neglect? All I know is that I can't buy them anymore. They still remain the best pair of headphones I've ever owned.</p>.                              </div><!-- /.entry-content -->.            </article><!-- /.hentry -->.                    <article class="hentry">.              <header>.                <div class="entry-meta">.                  <span class="entry-date date published updated"><time datetime="August 26th at 6:02pm"><a href="/blog/highly-dynamic-electromagnetic-linear-actuator">August 26, 2019</a></time></span><span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/about" title="About Pawe..

In the original repo, though, there were no instructions on how the styles have been compiled in the first place. I shouldn't have had to spend four hours reverse-engineering how that was done, but I did, and the results are in <a href="https://github.com/PawelAdamczuk/grav-theme-hpstr/tree/paweladamczuk-com">my fork</a>.
